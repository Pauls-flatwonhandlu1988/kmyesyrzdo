Just walked out of the theater, man. Wow. Brain's a bit scrambled like eggs in a kitchen where the chef is a tornado. Ethan Hunt? More like running more than... than anyone's run ever. If I had a dollar for every time he should've broken a bone, I could... download the movie, buy a ticket, and watch the darn thing five times over.

Popcorn everywhere, those little buttery devils. Why do they keep sneaking into my hoodie like they want to hitch a ride home? And the noise, oh my god, one dude just WOULD NOT stop coughing. Felt like a scene where the tension's just supposed to snap, but it's all phlegm and raspiness. I thought the speakers were gonna just explode.,

> Like a chase scene that lasts forever, but is it forever? Or just a loop in your mind where the motorbikes fly off cliffs and your heart says no thanks and tries to run away alone... Without you. The final reckoning feels like a house of cards in the wind that Tom Cruise won't let fall... Back aching from those theater seats, they don't make those for spine-having people, do they? 

There's this crazy part where they - wait, did you see the trailer? No spoiler, promise. They cut the wires but it's more wires and more decisions and suddenly I'm out of breath, and I'm just sitting there, with a soda - it tasted like betrayal, too sweet but not sweet enough?

It's like watching a cowboy on a caffeine rush trying to herd clouds through a storm, but the storm's the internet - wait what? Yeah. Missed calls, forgotten thoughts, but you gotta watch the movie like right now, with your whole face pressed to the screen, not literally just metaphorically. Maybe - not metaphorically, literally literally??

Parrot screeches in the background or my brain just added??

void ForgetItAll()
{
    try
    {
        Run(); // undefined Run?
    }
    catch(Exception ex)
    {
        // ???
    }
}
